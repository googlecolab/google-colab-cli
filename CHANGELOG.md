## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-16

### Changed

- **auth:** OAuth2 login now uses a remote copy-paste flow instead of a
  localhost callback server. The CLI prints an authorization URL with
  `redirect_uri=https://sdk.cloud.google.com/applicationdefaultauthcode.html`
  and `token_usage=remote`, then reads the pasted code from stdin. This works
  in headless/remote environments where a browser cannot reach a local
  callback port. (#54)

### Added

- **display output:** Rich rendering for `display_data` output via a shared
  `render_display_data()` helper. HTML is converted with `html2text` and
  rendered as Markdown, following a `text/markdown > text/html > text/plain`
  priority; `text/plain` is wrapped with `Text.from_ansi` to preserve embedded
  ANSI escapes. Applied consistently across `exec`, `console`/`repl`, and
  automation call sites. (#58)

### Fixed

- **keep-alive:** Replace the `RuntimeService/KeepAliveAssignment` RPC on
  `colab.pa.googleapis.com` with a Tunnel Frontend (TFE) HTTP ping
  (`GET /tun/m/<endpoint>/keep-alive/` with `X-Colab-Tunnel: Google`) on
  `colab.research.google.com`, authenticated by the user's own bearer token.
  The old RPC required `serviceusage` consumer access to Colab's internal
  project and returned HTTP 403 `USER_PROJECT_DENIED` for every external user,
  causing their sessions to be idle-pruned within minutes. The TFE ping needs
  no project entitlement; because the VM often does not answer on this path, a
  `ReadTimeout` is treated as success while genuine HTTP errors propagate.
  (#14, #61)

### Removed

- Dead grpc-web client-registry / API-key code path and the now-irrelevant
  `colaboratory`-scope / `pa.googleapis.com` pre-flight remediation messaging,
  superseded by the TFE keep-alive ping. (#61)
